# What is SereneApi?

SereneApi is intended to provide a straightforward way of consuming **RESTful** APIs requiring as little code & setup as possible whilst providing a powerful set of extensible tools.

**Why**
I found that creating Web Requests and Deserializing/Serializing tended to become tedious and in some cases break DRY. I also disliked how it usually made my code base look cluttered.
Most other implementation of RESTful libraries usually gave me a similar clutter like vibe which I wanted to avoid.

Serene removes this code clutter allowing for clean single line methods to be used for accessing resources; After using the Repository Pattern for many years I was inspired to create a API Handler that followed a similar pattern, this is what led to SereneApi.
